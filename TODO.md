# Roadmap

Planned features and known issues for LinearBot.

## Planned

### Views & Organization

- **Initiative view (`/initiatives`)** — dedicated route for initiative-level grouping; view projects grouped by strategic initiative with rollup metrics
- **Planning view** — surface projects in planning states (`shaping`, `ready`) from Linear; separate view or filter for upcoming work not yet started
- **Full year timeline** — extend Gantt chart to show entire year with previously completed projects; enable historical context alongside active work
- **Prioritization view** — impact/effort matrix with backlog organization
- **Metrics dashboard** — tie project metrics to primary initiatives

### Highlighting & Queue

- Surface what's pulled out vs. in (with reasoning)
- Request queue visibility ("asks" in Linear)

### Issue Management

- **Comment threshold** — configurable "no recent comment" threshold (currently hardcoded to business day logic)

### Project Tracking

- **Status labels** — consolidate Linear status label usage

### Filtering & Configuration

- **Configurable customer labels** — define a list of high-profile customer labels (e.g., AcmeCorp) that can be used to filter projects in Projects and Executive views; stored as app configuration

### Violation Alerts

- **Missing points label** — clearer messaging, exclude cancelled

### Real-time Updates

- **Webhook listeners** — implement Linear webhook listeners to receive real-time updates for issues and projects, eliminating the need for periodic syncing and ensuring immediate updates when issues are completed or projects change state
