# No PII in Version Control

## Rule

Never include personally identifiable information (PII) in files committed to git.

## What Counts as PII

- Real names of individuals (employees, contractors, customers)
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Physical addresses
- User IDs that can be traced to real people
- Any data that could identify a specific person

## Examples

### Bad

```markdown
To exclude Kevin DiVencenzo from metrics, add:
IGNORED_ASSIGNEE_NAMES=Kevin DiVencenzo
```

### Good

```markdown
To exclude specific assignees from metrics, add:
IGNORED_ASSIGNEE_NAMES=John Doe,External Contractor
```

## Where PII Belongs

- Environment variables (.env files are gitignored)
- Secrets management systems
- Private configuration not in version control

## Exceptions

- Public figures in attribution contexts (e.g., open source maintainers in LICENSE files)
- Your own name in commit messages (git config)
